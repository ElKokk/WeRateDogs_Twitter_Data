Wrangle `WeRateDogs` Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive isgreat
but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required.


The Data

Enhanced Twitter Archive

The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything. One column the archive does contain though: 
each tweet's text, which I used to extract rating, dog name, and dog "stage" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo).


In this project, I'll be using Tweepy to query Twitter's API for additional data beyond the data included in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive. 
This additional data will include retweet count and favorite count.
